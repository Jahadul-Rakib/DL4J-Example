##  Eclipse Deeplearning4j: SameDiff Examples

This project contains a set of examples that demonstrate the use of the SameDiff API. SameDiff is our automatic differentiation / deep learning framework. SameDiff uses a graph-based (define then run) approach, similar to TensorFlow graph mode. Eager graph (TensorFlow 2.x eager/PyTorch) graph execution is planned. SameDiff supports importing TensorFlow frozen model format .pb (protobuf) models. Import for ONNX, TensorFlow SavedModel and Keras models are planned. Note that Deeplearning4j also has full SameDiff support for easily writing custom layers and loss functions. Examples of importing TF models can be found [here](../tensorflow-keras-import-examples)

It is to be noted that neural networks can also be build using the higher level MultiLayerNetwork and ComputationalGraph DL4J APIs as noted [here](../dl4j-examples)

[Go back](../README.md) to the main repository page to explore other features/functionality of the **Eclipse Deeplearning4J** ecosystem. File an issue [here](https://github.com/eclipse/deeplearning4j-examples/issues) to request new features.

The examples in this project and what they demonstrate are briefly described below. This is also the recommended order to explore them in.
#### Basics
* [Ex1_SameDiff_Basics.java](./src/main/java/org/nd4j/examples/samediff/quickstart/basics/Ex1_SameDiff_Basics.java)
SameDiff class, variables, functions and forward pass
* [Ex2_LinearRegression.java](./src/main/java/org/nd4j/examples/samediff/quickstart/basics/Ex2_LinearRegression.java)
Placeholders, forward pass and gradient calculations on a simple linear regression graph
* [Ex3_Variables.java](./src/main/java/org/nd4j/examples/samediff/quickstart/basics/Ex3_Variables.java)
Alternate ways to create variables

#### Modelling
* [MNISTFeedforward.java](./src/main/java/org/nd4j/examples/samediff/quickstart/modeling/MNISTFeedforward.java)
Create, train, evaluate, save and load a basic feedforward network using SameDiff.
* [MNISTCNN.java](./src/main/java/org/nd4j/examples/samediff/quickstart/modeling/MNISTCNN.java)
The same as the above but with a CNN network
* [CustomListenerExample.java](./src/main/java/org/nd4j/examples/samediff/quickstart/modeling/CustomListenerExample.java)
Implementing a basic custom listener that records the values of 2 variables, for comparison or printing later.

#### Custom DL4J Layers and Vertices
DL4J has supported custom layers for a long time. However, using SameDiff layers has some advantages described [here](src/main/java/org/nd4j/examples/samediff/customizingdl4j/README.md).

* [Ex1BasicSameDiffLayerExample.java](./src/main/java/org/nd4j/examples/samediff/customizingdl4j/Ex1BasicSameDiffLayerExample.java)
Implement a custom DL4J layer using SameDiff.
* [Ex2LambdaLayer.java](./src/main/java/org/nd4j/examples/samediff/customizingdl4j/Ex2LambdaLayer.java)
Implement a simple custom DL4J lambda layer using SameDiff.
* [Ex3LambdaVertex.java](./src/main/java/org/nd4j/examples/samediff/customizingdl4j/Ex3LambdaVertex.java)
Implement a simple custom DL4J lambda vertex using SameDiff.
